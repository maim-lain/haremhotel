## Changelog:
#### Gameplay
- When starting a new game you will be asked if you want to enable the incest content. Choosing yes will automatically enable it for you.
- Does your harem have so many girls that you can't remember where your waifus are at specific times of the day? Well now you can just tell the receptionist that you are looking for someone and she will tell you what room every girl is in at that moment. (Only works for the first four girls for now)
- Before if you wanted to check the spy cams and spy on all the girls, first you would have to open the cam menu, then select a girl, then open the cam menu again, then select the next girl, and so on. It took around 25 clicks to see all the girls! Now you only have to click "Spy on girls" once, and it will automatically show you all the cams of any girl that is in her room.
- Added more Lin spanking. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

#### User Interface
- Created a new textbox to replace the default one. The new one is cleaner and less visually distracting.
- Changed the fonts and made the text slightly larger to make things more readable.
- Disabled a lot of the menu choices that don't do anything. This removes clutter and makes the UI cleaner. For example, 4 of Lin's interactions in the kitchen can only be done once per day, but even after you do them they would still be in the menu (even though you can't choose them). So now things like that are removed from the menu to make the UI less cluttered, and then reenabled once they actually become useable in the game.
- Made the navigation menus/choices less cluttered, but there's still room for improvement.

#### To do:
- In progress: Automatically receive packages outside of your door in the mornings.
- In progress: When you click on your bed to go to sleep the game will no longer ask if you're sure you want to sleep so you don't need to click "Yes" every single time.
- A new navigation system to make going to different places easier and faster would be really nice.
  - Add clickable signs that say Floor 1, Floor 2 next to the stairs?
- Remove more unusable/disabled choices for other girls, the utility room, etc. to unclutter menus
- Scene gallery?
